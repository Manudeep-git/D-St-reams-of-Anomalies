# D(St)reams of Anomalies
The real world does not slow down for bad data

The following objectives were listed for the project


1.Download the benchmark data set from https://www.kaggle.com/boltzmannbrain/nab or https://github.com/numenta/NAB/tree/master/data <br>
2.Load the one of the data set into panda data frames<br>
3.Formulate one or two ideas on how feature engineering would help the data set to establish additional value using exploratory data analysis<br>
4.Build one or more anomaly detection models to determine the anomalies using the other columns as features<br>
